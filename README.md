#This is a fun project. I am using javascript for the logic part of this project.
 I am using html canvas element as my container.
  The canvas is a rectangular area on an html page.By default the canvas has no content and no border. This is where the game will be played. 
On my board, i am using the physics concept of velocity to move the snake,this will enable it to find the food and eat.
