#This is a fun project. I am using javascript for the logic part of this project.

I am using html canvas element as my container.
The canvas is a rectangular area on an html page.By default the canvas has no content and no border. This is where the game will be played.
On my board, i am using the physics concept of velocity to move the snake to be able to find the food and eat.
Speed:

Scalar quantity: Speed is a scalar, meaning it only has magnitude (how fast an object is moving) and does not account for direction.
Formula: Speed is calculated as the total distance traveled divided by the time taken.
Speed
=
Distance
Time
Speed=
Time
Distance
​

Unit: The SI unit of speed is meters per second (m/s), but it can also be expressed in other units like km/h or miles per hour.
Example: If a car travels 100 km in 2 hours, its speed is
100
 km
2
 hours
=
50
 km/h
2 hours
100 km
​
=50 km/h.
Velocity:

Vector quantity: Velocity is a vector, meaning it includes both magnitude (speed) and direction.
Formula: Velocity is the displacement (the straight-line distance between the starting and ending points) divided by the time taken.
Velocity
=
Displacement
Time
Velocity=
Time
Displacement
​

Unit: Like speed, velocity is measured in meters per second (m/s).
Example: If the same car travels 100 km north in 2 hours, its velocity is 50 km/h north. If it changes direction, its velocity changes, even if the speed stays the same.
In short, speed tells you how fast something is moving, while velocity tells you both how fast and in what direction it is moving.
